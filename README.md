Rules:
You may not use any external libraries to solve this problem, but you may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes. Specifically, you may use unit-testing libraries or build tools available for your chosen language (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Rspec, Rake, Rhinomocks, Jasmine, Rspec, Nosetests etc.).
System security is very important to us and certain file extensions will be blocked for security purposes, resulting in delays to your application. You should NOT include any executable attachments, including those with .exe or .lib extensions. We need to be able to run and build your code ourselves, so please submit your code as a zipped file of source code and supporting files, without any compiled code. If you're submitting in C#, please do not submit your code as a .msi file.
Please include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions, along with your code, as well as detailed instructions to run your application.
We assess a number of things including the design aspect of your solution and your object oriented programming skills. While these are small problems, we expect you to submit what you believe is production-quality code; code that you’d be able to run, maintain and evolve. You don’t need to gold plate your solution, however, we are looking for something more than a bare-bones algorithm.
We want our hiring process to be fair, and for everyone to start from the same place. To enable this, we request that you do not share or publish these problems.
Please compress your files into a single .zip file before sharing. Kindly ensure there are no executables in your submission. Our system blocks executable files for security purposes, and we want to avoid any delays in your process.
**Executables include asp, bat, class, cmd, com, cpl, dll, exe, fon, hta, ini, ins, iw, jar, jsp, js, jse, pif, scr, shs, sh, vb, vbe, vbs, ws, wsc, wsf, wsh & msi
As a general rule, we allow three days from the date that you receive these instructions to submit your code, but you may request more time from your recruiter if needed. If you have any questions about the code as it relates to your interview process, please do mail it across.
